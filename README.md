# Finger-Finder
CNN for fingertip detection using MNIST architecture, 11k Hands dataset, and NUS Hand Dataset

Requires OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow.
Tested using Python 2 but should work with 3.
This is part of a project I'm working on that will allow users to play piano using nothing but a camera.
  
To try it out, simply run predict.py and click somewhere in the image that pops up.
